# mice-exploration-tool
Visual Data Exploration tool for Musculoskeletal Phenotyping in mice.

# Repo Details
This repository is the work of the Group 34 TSE team creating a data visualisation tool for DICOM images to support the work of the IMPC. 

# Experimental web app link
This weblink works best in Chrome. There is a delay of 2 seconds before the first image shows (it's just one example site). It may take circa 10 seconds for the first image to show as they are being taken pulled from GitHub and not local storage. There is also a link on the site header to navigate to a page that displays a Base64 image. An additional link also shows a grid of various DICOM images taken from a var imageArray composed of URLs. This imageArray could be populated by a MySql query pulling in images as per a users requirements.
