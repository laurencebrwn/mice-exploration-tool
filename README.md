# mice-exploration-tool
Visual Data Exploration tool for musculoskeletal phenotyping in mice.

# Repo Details
This repository is the work of the Group 34 TSE team creating a data visualisation tool for DICOM images to support the work of the IMPC. 

# Experimental web app link
This weblink works besy in Chrome. There is a delay of 2 seconds before the first image shows (it's just ane example site). It may take circa 10 seconds for the first image to show. There is also a link on the site header to navigate to a page that displays a Base64 image. An additional link also shows a grid of various DICOM images taken from a var imageArray composed of URLs. This imageArray could be populated by a MySql query pulling in images as per a users requirements.
